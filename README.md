# Credit-Cards-sales
Credit Card Sales Analysis - SQL Server Project This project is designed to showcase a comprehensive SQL Server-based approach for analyzing and managing credit card sales data. The objective is to extract meaningful insights, such as sales trends, customer behaviors, and card usage patterns, using SQL queries and data analysis techniques.
Project Overview
This project models a real-world scenario where customer credit card transactions are analyzed to generate valuable insights. By creating and querying relational tables, the project demonstrates key SQL concepts such as:

Database Design: Structuring tables for customers, credit cards, and sales transactions.
SQL Queries: Writing complex queries to extract insights from data.
Data Insights: Gaining business intelligence from the data to understand sales trends, customer behavior, and more.
Key Features
Database Schema: The project uses three primary tables:

Customers: Contains customer information such as name, age, gender, and email.
CreditCards: Stores details about the issued credit cards, such as card type, issue date, and expiry date.
Sales: Tracks the sales transactions made with each credit card, including the sale amount and date.
SQL Queries:

Total Sales by Card Type: Analyzing how different card types perform in terms of sales.
Average Sale by Customer Age Group: Understanding customer spending behavior across different age groups.
Sales Trends: Identifying seasonal sales trends by month.
Top 5 Customers with the Highest Sales: Recognizing the most engaged customers based on their purchase volume.
Sales by Card Type and Month: Analyzing monthly sales trends across different card types.
Data Analysis: The project focuses on generating insights related to:

Sales performance by card type.
Customer behavior segmented by age group.
Sales activity across different months.
Identification of top customers and their purchase patterns.
Technologies Used
SQL Server: For creating, managing, and querying the relational database.
T-SQL: For writing advanced queries, joins, and aggregations.
Excel (Optional): For visualizations and reporting (if needed).
PowerPoint (Optional): For presenting the results in a structured manner.
